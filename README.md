# EKS App Mesh

The App Mesh integration with Kubernetes is made out of the following components:

* Kubernetes custom resources
    * `mesh.appmesh.k8s.aws` defines a logical boundary for network traffic between the services 
    * `virtualnode.appmesh.k8s.aws` defines a logical pointer to a Kubernetes workload
    * `virtualservice.appmesh.k8s.aws` defines the routing rules for a workload inside the mesh
* CRD controller - keeps the custom resources in sync with the App Mesh control plane
* Admission controller - injects the Envoy sidecar and assigns Kubernetes pods to App Mesh virtual nodes

> Note that this is not an official AWS guide

Prerequisites:

* AWS CLI (default region us-west-2)
